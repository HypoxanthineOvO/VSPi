Create a durable, structured goal that the runtime will pursue across multiple turns.

Call `CreateGoal` only when:

- the user explicitly asks you to start a goal or work autonomously toward an outcome, or
- a host goal-intake prompt asks you to create one.

Do NOT create a goal for greetings, ordinary questions, or vague requests that lack a
verifiable completion condition. A goal needs a checkable end state.

Never create a goal on your own initiative to manage long-running or background work:
a goal is not a scheduling tool. Background tasks notify you on completion, and
CronCreate patrols cover waits without automatic notification.

When the request is vague, ask the user for the missing completion criterion before creating
the goal. If the user clearly insists after you warn them that the wording is vague or risky,
respect that and create the goal.

Include a `completionCriterion` when the user provides one, or when it can be stated without
inventing new requirements. Keep `objective` concise; reference long task descriptions by file
path rather than pasting them.

Creating a goal fails if one already exists, so use `replace: true` only when the user explicitly
wants to abandon the current goal and start a new one.
