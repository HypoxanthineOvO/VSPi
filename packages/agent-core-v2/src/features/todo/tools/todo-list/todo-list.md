Use this tool to maintain a structured one- or two-level TODO list as you work through a multi-step task. Use it proactively and often when progress tracking helps the current work. This is especially useful in long-running investigations and implementation tasks with several tool calls; in plan mode, write the plan to the plan file rather than tracking it here.

**When to use:**
- Multi-step tasks that span several tool calls
- Tracking investigation progress across a large codebase search
- Planning a sequence of edits before making them
- After receiving new multi-step instructions, capture the requirements as todos
- Group related work under a parent with `children` when a second level improves clarity
- Before starting tracked work, mark exactly one actionable leaf item as `in_progress`
- Immediately after finishing a leaf item, mark it `done`; do not batch completions at the end

**When NOT to use:**
- Single-shot answers that complete in one or two tool calls
- Trivial requests where tracking adds no clarity
- Purely conversational or informational replies

**Avoid churn:**
- Do not re-call this tool when nothing meaningful has changed since the last call — update the list only after real progress.
- When unsure of the current state, call query mode first (omit `todos`) to check the list before deciding what to update.
- If no available tool can move any task forward, tell the user where you are stuck instead of repeatedly re-ordering the same todos.

**How to use:**
- Call with `todos: [...]` to replace the full list. A top-level item may be an actionable leaf with `status`, or a group with `children`; children are leaves and cannot have another level.
- Do not provide `status` for a group. Its status is derived from its children.
- Call with no `todos` argument to retrieve the current list without changing it.
- Call with `todos: []` to clear the list.
- Keep titles short and actionable (e.g. "Read session-control.ts", "Add planMode flag to TurnManager").
- Update statuses as you make progress.
- When work is underway, keep exactly one actionable leaf task `in_progress`.
- Only mark a task `done` when it is fully accomplished.
- Never mark a task `done` if tests are failing, implementation is partial, unresolved errors remain, or required files/dependencies could not be found.
- If you encounter a blocker, keep the blocked task `in_progress` or add a new pending task describing what must be resolved.
